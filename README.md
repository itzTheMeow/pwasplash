# pwasplash

A small dependency-free utility to generate splash images for iOS PWAs automatically. This does not generate app icons, as those are easier to do yourself.

Supports a few custom options for optimal image generation.

This is inspired by [pwacompat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pwacompat), but implements it way better while sacrificing some browser support. (IE is dead)
